# LibReplicaRender

This is a basic, work-in-progress rendering library built using the Win32 API and DirectX 11.1 with GLM and Dear IMGUI for math and UI, respectively. It was built partly as an educational exercise and partly to test post-process effects. This library is still missing a lot of basic functionality and is not in any kind of state for use in development, let alone production, but you're more than welcome to peruse its contents.
